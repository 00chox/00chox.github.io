# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 



## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge was to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- index.html
- style.css


### What I learned

I learned how to use ':hover' , got a better understanding of 'display: flex;' and 'position: absolute', for example:
```
```css
.name:hover {
  color: var(--Cyan, #00fff8);
  font-feature-settings: "clig" off, "liga" off;
  font-family: Outfit;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  line-height: normal;
}
``
```
.img {
  display: flex;
  border-radius: 8px;
  width: 350px;
  height: 350px;
}
``
```
.eye {
  position: absolute;
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;
  margin: 150px;
  visibility: hidden;
} 
``
```

### Continued development

I will continue focusing on creating a good html structure.
I want to learn more CSS properties, so I can style my divs beautifully.


### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php) - This helped me understand the content of ':hover'.
- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp) - This showed me how to use 'visibility:' property.
